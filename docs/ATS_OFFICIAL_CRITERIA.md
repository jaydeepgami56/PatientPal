# Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) - Official Clinical Criteria

**Based on:** ACEM Guidelines 2023 & Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care 2024

---

## Overview

The Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) is a five-level triage system used across Australia and New Zealand to prioritize patient care in Emergency Departments based on clinical urgency.

### Framework
- **Assessment Method:** ABCD (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability)
- **79 Clinical Descriptors** covering physiological predictors
- **Performance Targets:** Category-specific targets for maximum wait times

---

## ATS Categories with Official Criteria

### ATS Category 1 - IMMEDIATELY LIFE-THREATENING
**Treatment Time:** Immediate (0 minutes)
**Performance Target:** 100% seen immediately
**Description:** Resuscitation required. Conditions threatening life requiring immediate aggressive intervention.

#### Clinical Descriptors:

## Special Population Considerations

### Paediatric (<16 years)
- **Lower threshold** for triage category elevation
- **Paediatric early warning signs:** reduced activity, poor feeding, altered behaviour
- **Fever in infants:** <3 months with fever >38°C → ATS 2
- **Dehydration signs** in children → escalate category
- **Respiratory rates:** Children have higher normal rates

### Pregnancy
- Any **significant bleeding** → ATS 2 minimum
- **Reduced fetal movements** → ATS 3
- **Abdominal pain in 3rd trimester** → ATS 3 minimum
- **Pre-eclampsia signs** → ATS 2
- **Placental abruption** → ATS 1

### Elderly (>65 years)
- **Lower threshold** for escalation
- **Atypical presentations** common
- **Falls** → assess for serious injury
- **Confusion** → investigate underlying cause
- **Sepsis** presentation may be subtle

### Immunocompromised
- **Lower threshold** for infection concerns
- **Fever** → escalate category
- **Signs of sepsis** → ATS 2 minimum

---

## Critical Assessment Rules

### Precautionary Principle
**If uncertain between two categories, assign the higher urgency.**

### ABCD Framework
**Primary assessment structure:**
- **A**irway - obstruction, compromise
- **B**reathing - respiratory rate, SpO2, distress
- **C**irculation - blood pressure, heart rate, perfusion
- **D**isability - GCS, neurological status

### Pain Assessment
**0-10 Scale Integration:**
- 1-2: Minor pain → ATS 5
- 3-4: Moderate pain → ATS 4
- 5-7: Severe pain → ATS 3
- 8-10: Very severe pain → ATS 2

**Note:** Severe pain (≥7/10) may indicate serious pathology

### Chest Pain Rule
**Always assume cardiac until proven otherwise → ATS 2 minimum**

### Deteriorating Patient
**Any evidence of clinical deterioration → escalate category immediately**

### Red Flags (Immediate Escalation)
- Airway compromise
- Severe breathing difficulty
- Circulatory shock
- Altered consciousness
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Signs of stroke (FAST)

### Time-Critical Conditions
Require urgent assessment and intervention:
- **Stroke** (FAST positive)
- **Myocardial Infarction** (chest pain with cardiac features)
- **Major trauma**
- **Sepsis** (abnormal vital signs)

## Physiological Vital Sign Ranges

### Respiratory Rate (breaths/min)
- **Normal adult:** 12-20
- **Abnormal:** <8 or >30 (consider escalation)
- **Paediatric:** Age-dependent (higher normal rates)

### Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)
- **ATS 1:** <90% despite oxygen
- **ATS 2:** 90-94% on oxygen
- **ATS 3:** 95-96%
- **Normal:** >97%

### Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- **Severe shock (ATS 1):** Systolic <80 with poor perfusion
- **Moderate shock (ATS 2):** Systolic 80-100
- **Severe hypertension (ATS 2):** >220/120 with symptoms

- **ATS 2:** GCS 9-12 (altered consciousness)
- **ATS 3:** GCS 13-14 (moderately altered)
- **ATS 4-5:** GCS 15 (alert and oriented)

### Temperature

- **Mild:** Mildly dry mucous membranes → ATS 4-5

### Respiratory (Paediatric)
- **Severe distress:** Grunting, nasal flaring, retractions → ATS 2
- **Moderate distress:** Increased work of breathing → ATS 3
- **Stridor:** Airway concern → ATS 1-2 depending on severity

## Integration in Medical Triage AI

This ATS criteria has been integrated into:
- **`utils/prompts.py`** - TRIAGE_PROMPT with complete official descriptors
- **`pages/Triage_agent.py`** - Validation against ATS standards
- **`utils/logger.py`** - Logging of ATS assessments

All triage assessments in the system use these official criteria to ensure compliance with Australian health standards.
