## 📝 Recommendations

### Manual Updates Recommended

1. **README.md (Root)**
   - Add brief note about FastAPI + React at the top
   - Link to QUICKSTART.md
   - No major rewrite needed - Streamlit docs still valid

2. **Future Documentation**
   - As Agent Configuration page is implemented, document in INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
   - As Results Dashboard is built, add to INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
   - When authentication is added, create AUTHENTICATION.md

### Documentation Maintenance

- Keep [docs/INDEX.md](docs/INDEX.md) updated as new docs are added
- Update version dates in document headers when making changes
- Maintain sync between code and documentation
- Add new endpoints to README_INTEGRATION.md as they're created
